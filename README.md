# NBA_map
Utilizes leaflet's map api to create a map UI connected to a mongoDB backend and enables users to find the closest NBA team to an American city.

## Usage
### Connect to node server
Within your server, create a port connection to my node server's port; it is located within the .env file that I have personally sent you.

### React frontend
The react frontend can be extrapolated to be used within your application by taking the React.js pages into your frontend. The frontend has dependencies such as leaflet, react-leaflet, react-router-dom, and react-router so that a map layer could be initialized and used.
